## Code Integration

- Initially we developed every features individually, fetched the code from main branch and then developed individual feature in respective branch
- After development, pushed and merged everyones branch into main branch as a central development repository, ready for deployment to the Heroku.

## Getting Started

In this assignment, as it the frontend of the application 'Housify', one can examin the application while running the application locally by following steps as mentioned below.

### Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - NodeJS, A Java Script runtime (for react frontend)

See the following section for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to install this software / libraries / plug-ins

### Installing

Here are steps to follow to get a development environment running.
(At this point, we assume that 'Node' as mentioned above in installed in local environment)

Note: There are some libraries which were used to create a react app are: axios, react-router-dom, react-bootstrap

Step 1: To verify if Node is installed on the system, open a command prompt (if windows), and write `node` to the terminal, verify that system will respond with valid node version.

i.e.,

```
Welcome to Node.js v16.13.2.
Type ".help" for more information.
```

Step 2: Open a folder in any code editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Step 3: Clone remote git repository by running following command in cmd: `git clone https://git.cs.dal.ca/oza/csci-5709-group-12`

Step 4: As you can observe the source code has been pulled from the reomote repository, now move to the cloned git directory.

Step 5: It is a time to install all the dependencies which are necessary to run Assignment 3 frontend, to do that, run following command in the cmd: `npm install` / `npm i`

Step 6: We have all the dependencies installed, we can run the application, for that run the following command in the cmd: `npm start`

This way, the "Assignment 3" frontend project is up and running on the local host, displaying the Login Form on home screen, you can interact with the application now (Assuming that backend is running).

There will be A Sign-in Page as initial screen, one can visit the registration page from sign-in page (assuming that back-end is running, as user authentication is linked with backend)

## Built With

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - A platform to deploy
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - A language to develope back-end api, in conjuction with express
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - A code editor
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- [bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap) - A framework for creation of responsive sited including better UX.
- [react-boostrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap) - Bootstrap 5 components built with React.
- [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) - To build react router in web applications
